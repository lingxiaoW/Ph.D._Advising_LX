* **Paper Writing**: 3D Odor Source Localization.
  * **Tasks**:
    * **Pesudo Code**:
    
    ```
    while True:
       gas_concentrtaion, wind_info = SensorReading(Drone_Position) # Gas Model
       drone_status = Get_Drone_status(Drone_Position)   # **API** 
       Next_Way_Point = Navigation_Controller(gas_concentration, wind_info, drone_status) # Olfactory-based navigation algorithm
       drone_speed_cmd = drone_control(next_way_point)      # **API**
       drone_status = env.step(drone_speed_cmd)          # **API**
       drone_position = drone_status[1]                  # **API**
       if drone_position == source_location:
           break 
    ```
    * **Code:**
      * main function is a .py file. IF you need other functions, create separate .py files and import these functions into the main. 
    
    * **Dimension Match:**
      * Drone simulation env: x: -4 to 4, y: -4 to 4, z: 0 to 2. Resolution:
      * Plume Simulation env: x: -50.0 to 300, y: -150.0 to 150.0, z: 0 to 100. Resolution: 
      * Unify them: x: -50.0 to 300, y: -150.0 to 150.0, z: 0.0 to 20.0

    * [ x ] **File 1: Sensor Reading**:
      * Get the **gas concentration** and **wind speed/direction** at drone location.
      * Input: (x, y, z)
      * Output: gas_concentration (c), wind_speed (v), wind_direction (phi). 
    
    * [ x ] **File 2: Get Drone Status**:
      * Get the drone_location, heading, speed, etc.
      * Input: simulation_time (t)
      * Output: drone_position, drone_heading

    * [ x ] **File 3: Navigation Controller (Plume Tracing Control Algorithm)**: 
       ``` 
        If con > threshold:
          target_heading = wind_dir + 180
        else:
          target_heading = wind_dir + 90
       ```
        * Input: c, phi
        * Output: heading_command

    * [ ] **File 4: Drone Control**
      * Convert the heading command into the next way point.
      * Input: heading_command
      * Output: way_point

    * **NEW**: 2D or 3D gas plume data. we need to know the gas concentration at every point within the environment.
      * Use a grid, then assign concentration, wind speed at each cell.
      * Use a equation (Gassuian-based plume model) to calculate the gas concentration at a given location. 


* **NEW: Real-world Platform:**
  * We need an indoor testing field. The drone flies inside of a lab to find the gas source location. 
  * CrazyFlie-based: 
    * Search CrazyFlie to have an executable plan:
      * What to purchase, how to control it, how to determine the position, etc.
