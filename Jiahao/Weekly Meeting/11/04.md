* **Paper Writing**: 3D Odor Source Localization.
  * **Tasks**:
    * Pesudo Code:
    
    ```
    while True:
       gas_concentrtaion, wind_info = SensorReading(Drone_Position) # Gas Model
       drone_status = Get_Drone_status(Drone_Position)   # **API** 
       Next_Way_Point = Navigation_Controller(gas_concentration, wind_info, drone_status) # Olfactory-based navigation algorithm
       drone_speed_cmd = drone_control(next_way_point)      # **API**
       drone_status = env.step(drone_speed_cmd)          # **API**
       drone_position = drone_status[1]                  # **API**
       if drone_position == source_location:
           break 
    ```

    * Control Algorithm: 
      * If con > threshold:
          target_heading = wind_dir + 180
        else:
          target_heading = wind_dir + 90

    * **NEW**: 2D or 3D gas plume data. we need to know the gas concentration at every point within the environment.
      * Use a grid, then assign concentration, wind speed at each cell.
      * Use a equation (Gassuian-based plume model) to calculate the gas concentration at a given location. 


* **NEW: Real-world Platform:**
  * We need an indoor testing field. The drone flies inside of a lab to find the gas source location. 
  * CrazyFlie-based: 
    * Search CrazyFlie to have an executable plan:
      * What to purchase, how to control it, how to determine the position, etc.
