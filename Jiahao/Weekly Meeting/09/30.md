* **Paper Writing**: 3D Odor Source Localization.
  * **Tasks**:
    * We need a python code to control the drone. 
    * We need a python code to simulate odor distribution.
    * Pesudo Code:
    
    ```
    while True:
       gas_concentrtaion = SensorReading(Drone_Position) # Gas Model
       drone_status = Get_Drone_status(Drone_Position)   # **API** 
       Next_Way_Point = Navigation_Controller(gas_concentration, drone_status) # Olfactory-based navigation algorithm
       drone_status = drone_control(next_way_point)      # **API**
       drone_position = drone_status[1]                  # **API**
       if drone_position == source_location:
           break 
    ```
    * We should be able to change the drone's command in each second.
    * **NEW**: Random generate 10 new way points for the drone to follow. 
      * Organize the functions. 


* **NEW: Real-world Platform:**
  * We need an indoor testing field. The drone flies inside of a lab to find the gas source location. 
  * CrazyFlie-based: 
    * Search CrazyFlie to have an executable plan:
      * What to purchase, how to control it, how to determine the position, etc.
