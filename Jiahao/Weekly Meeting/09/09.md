* **Simulators**: 
  * **LX: I need a demo**
  * Python based:  
  1. https://github.com/spencerfolk/rotorpy (A Python-based multirotor simulation environment)
     https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04485 

  2. https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones (Simple OpenAI Gym environment based on PyBullet for multi-agent reinforcement learning)
     https://utiasdsl.github.io/gym-pybullet-drones/
     https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02142

  3. AirSim (Microsoft Open Source)

  * ROS based

  * MATLAB based:
  1. Scenario Simulation
    https://www.mathworks.com/help/uav/scenario-simulation.html(Tutorial)
  2. Matlabâ€“Simulink co-simulation with Xplane and FlightGear

* **NEW: Real-world Platform:**
  * We need an indoor testing field. The drone flies inside of a lab to find the gas source location. 
  * CrazyFlie-based: 
    * Search CrazyFlie to have an executable plan:
      * What to purchase, how to control it, how to determine the position, etc. 

* **Step 1:** Our goal is to have a drone simulator that can simulate movement of a drone. 
  * We can control the drone by providing way points
  * We can get drone's speed, position, and orientation
