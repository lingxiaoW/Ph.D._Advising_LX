* **Simulators**: 
  * A Python-based multirotor simulation environment:
    * [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04485)
    * **Tasks:**
      * Get familiar with the API
      * How to get drone's position, orientation, speed, etc.  
  * AirSim (Microsoft Open Source)
    * [Code](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/tree/main)
    * [Paper](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/apis/)
    * **Tasks**:
      * Get familiar with the API
      * How to get drone's position, orientation, speed, etc.
      * First-Person-View image.
      * We need a forest environment. 

* **Paper Writing**: 3D Odor Source Localization.
  * **Tasks**:
    * We need a python code to control the drone. 
    * We need a python code to simulate odor distribution.
    * Pesudo Code:
    
    ```
    while True:
       gas_concentrtaion = SensorReading(Drone_Position) # Gas Model
       drone_status = Get_Drone_status(Drone_Position)   # **API** 
       Next_Way_Point = Navigation_Controller(gas_concentration, drone_status) # Olfactory-based navigation algorithm
       drone_status = drone_control(next_way_point)      # **API**
       drone_position = drone_status[1]                  # **API**
       if drone_position == source_location:
           break 
    ```
    * 3D Gas Model:


* **NEW: Real-world Platform:**
  * We need an indoor testing field. The drone flies inside of a lab to find the gas source location. 
  * CrazyFlie-based: 
    * Search CrazyFlie to have an executable plan:
      * What to purchase, how to control it, how to determine the position, etc. 

* **Step 1:** Our goal is to have a drone simulator that can simulate movement of a drone. 
  * We can control the drone by providing way points
  * We can get drone's speed, position, and orientation
