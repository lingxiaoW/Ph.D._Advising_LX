* **Paper Writing**: 3D Odor Source Localization.
  * **Tasks**:
    * **Pesudo Code**:

* **Task 1: Drone-based Gas Source Localization**
  * [ ] Plot drone trajectory with the gas plume model
  * [ ] Try different search strategies:
    * The main idea is "lawn mower" + "surge" + "casting"
    * Add multiple layers. 
  * [ ] Once you have a Multiple drone initial locations.


* **NEW: Real-world Platform:**
  * We need an indoor testing field. The drone flies inside of a lab to find the gas source location. 
  * CrazyFlie-based: 
    * Search CrazyFlie to have an executable plan:
      * What to purchase, how to control it, how to determine the position, etc.
