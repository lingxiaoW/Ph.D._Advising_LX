* **Deep Learning-based Satellite Data Retrieval**
  * [x] Check the proposal (Project Narrative - New) in the folder "D:\Github\Ph.D._Advising_LX\Hoang\Reference\Deep Learning-based Satellite Data Retrieval"
* Find serval tutorials for CNN/RNN **time series prediction** using Pytorch.
    * How to prepare a dataset in Pytorch? 
    * How to define a model in Pytorch?
    * How to train the model with the dataset in Pytorch? 
    * In our next meeting, you show me the tutorial code you find, which part is defining a dataset, which part is defining a model, which part is defining the training loop.
    * You can use CoLab. Eventually you will use Pycharm
