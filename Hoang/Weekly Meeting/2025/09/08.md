  * [x] Check the proposal (Project Narrative - New) in the folder "D:\Github\Ph.D._Advising_LX\Hoang\Reference\Deep Learning-based Satellite Data Retrieval"
  * [x] Get familiar with two objectives presented in the proposal
    * Objective 1: DL Model Design

    **9/8**: Read Objective 1 - DL Model Design: Focus on developing novel deep learning architectures to supplant computationally intensive components in traditional data retrieval algorithms.
    **Key insights**: The project's core innovation lies in leveraging DL to accelerate data retrieval by approximating expensive simulations (e.g., VRT calculations) with learned models. The time-series nature of the data necessitates architectures that handle sequential patterns, explaining the choice of CNN (for local feature extraction) and RNN (for long-range dependencies).
        
    **9/9**: Cont. reading Objective 1 - Sliding Window Technique: To exploit the time-series structure, a sliding window approach transforms the data into sequential inputs suitable for DL models.
    **9/10**: Cont. reading Objective 1 - New DL Models: CNN Architecture: CNNs excel at local pattern detection via convolutions, ideal for time-series where short-term motifs (e.g., spectral peaks in satellite data) repeat. They replace VRT's differential equation solving with learned filters, reducing compute. For time-series, 1D CNNs treat sequences as "1D images." Benefits: Translation invariance (robust to shifts in time), parameter sharing (fewer weights than fully connected nets), and scalability to large n (2M samples).
