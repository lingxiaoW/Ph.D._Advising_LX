* **Deep Learning-based Satellite Data Retrieval**
  * [x] Check the proposal (Project Narrative - New) in the folder "D:\Github\Ph.D._Advising_LX\Hoang\Reference\Deep Learning-based Satellite Data Retrieval"
* Find serval tutorials for CNN/RNN **time series prediction** using Pytorch.
   *[x] How to prepare a dataset in Pytorch?


* [x] Implement the CNN/RNN-based prediction with the Satellite dataset. 
* [ ] Use Pycharm to create the training code. 
    * Install and configure anaconda (follow the tutorial).
    * Create a python project using pycharm with separate files: main.py, model.py, training.py, dataset.py. 
    * 2 separate projects: one for CNN, one for RNN.
