* **Deep Learning-based Satellite Data Retrieval**
    * [x] Transformer-based time series prediction
        * Start with an example (a Transformer example for time-series prediction). 
    * Plot the 22 output features.

* [ ] Report
    * Upload code on GitHub: 
        * create new repository name it as "Deep Learning-based Satellite Data Retrieval"
        * Make it private no. Invite Dr. Wang as collaborator
        * Contain 3 folders: CNN, RNN, Transformer
        * Readme as README file as each folder
    * Draw dataset diagram 
        * Explain CNN, RNN, Transfomer: how to combine dataset
        * The explaination should the same as code
    * Draw model diagram
        * Explain CNN, RNN, Transfomer: how to build the model
        * Find some example (Transformer paper: how they draw the diagram)
        * The explaination should the same as code
    * List training parameters (from the code)
* [ ] Computer
    * New computer next week: install all necessary softwares
