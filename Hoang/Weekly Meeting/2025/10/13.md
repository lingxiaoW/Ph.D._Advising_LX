    * [x] Transformer-based time series prediction
        * Start with an example (a Transformer example for time-series prediction). 
    * Plot the 22 output features.

* You can use ChatGPT to give you suggestions on code development, but you need to understand the code. ChatGPT makes mistakes.

* [ ] Create 3 projects, one for CNN, one for RNN, and one for Transformer
* [ ] Draw the dataset diagram. (the cube diagram, explain each length to me). 
* [ ] Khan has some Transfromer projects before. Ask him for the Transformer code. 
* [ ] For CNN and RNN, show me the polarity plot.
