* **Deep Learning-based Satellite Data Retrieval**
    * [x] Transformer-based time series prediction
        * Start with an example (a Transformer example for time-series prediction). 
    * Plot the 22 output features.

* [ ] Compare the accuracy of CNN, RNN, Transformer-encoder, and Transformer.
    * Include the transformer decoder.
    * Compare their RMSE. Show me a table (for all the comparison)
    * I will upload an other data chunk (you just use it for testing)
