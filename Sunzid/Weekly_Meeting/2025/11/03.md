## 1. Paper Writing
* [x] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**
* [ ] Methodology
  * [ ] Keep the current implementation and create two new control files
  * [ ] Add adaptiveStep control algorithms - take larger step when the entropy is high.
  * [ ] Check decision making based on entropy reduction.
  * [ ] Change all normalization to min-max [0-1] range.
  * [ ] Delete sigma noise in Bayesian agent.
  * [ ] Add explanation of percentile.
  
* [x] Experiments
  * [ ] Clean the code
    * [ ] Upload on Github code page.
    

 * [ ] Start writing the Experiment Section on the paper draft
   * [ ] Start talking about the simulation environment. Create a map of the reachable points - two top down view maps for room 1 and 2, show objects snaps in the top down map (oven, table, toilet, etc.).
   * [ ] Sample run of 3 algorithms.
   * [ ] Repeated test, combined trajectories and table
     * [ ] Table: show travelled distance, success rate, number of steps


## 3. Teaching the Lab
* You need to go through the lab manual before students do the lab.
* Your first class will be at next week.
