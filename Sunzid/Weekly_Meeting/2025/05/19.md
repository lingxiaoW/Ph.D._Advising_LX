## 1. Paper Writing
* [ ] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**
  * Search for "LX: " in overleaf. Address my questions and comments.
  Subtitles:
  * An overview: (flow diagram: in-output of infotax and vision branch > fusion) parameters of input-output.
    * [ ] **06-09**: Simple flow chart in the overview. Current one is too complex. **06-11**: Edit the flow chart, follow the vilt paper.
    * Olfaction branch: source likelihood map
      * [ ] **06-09**: detailed explaination, every parameter needs to be explained. don't jump steps. **06-11** You miss the key equation explanation: convert the concentration to likelihood map eqn 9.
      * [ ] **06-09**: Use pesduo code to explain the infotaxis algorithm (how other people explain infotaxis)
      * [ ] **06-19**: Source term estimation seems to fit the equation. understand the thoery and check if we can use this thoery for our paper.
      * [ ] **06-25**: Adpat source term estimation to fit our concentration equation.
         * Write equations in full details.   
         * **Our goal**: we need a source probability estimation algorithm without wind information.
         * **06-30**: your code should follow your literature.
         * **07-03**: source term estimation. Find a toy example on source term estimation. Figure out the thoery and then do the step-by-step analysis on OSL. 
      * Vision branch: semantic grounding
      * Fusion
      
## Real world implementation
* [ ] Figure out how to integrate chemical sensor with the Turtlebot4  
  * [ ] Find examples where people use Turtlebot4 with other sensors (such as examples of people use Turtlebot4 usb ports. perhaps the USB port is the solution. Perhaps the usb port and Power and Read sensor data simultaneously)  
  * Link 1:  
  * Link 2:  
  * ... ...  
      
## Sample run
* [ ] Live demonstration in June 4th 10:00 AM
  * Prepare some demos with Turtlebot 3 or 4.  

## Source declaration  
* [x] Develop a source declaration method based on olfactory entropy threshold
