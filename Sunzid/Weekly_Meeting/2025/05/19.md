## 1. Paper Writing
* [ ] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**  
      * Search for "LX: " in overleaf. Address my questions and comments.  
      * Make a copy of the overleaf file, edit on the new overleaf file. Sometimes you need to totally change a paragraph. Don't delete my comments. If you complete a comment, write a checked at the end of comments.  
      Subtitles:  
      * An overview: (flow diagram: in-output of infotax and vision branch > fusion) parameters of input-output.
           * [ ] **06-09**: Simple flow chart in the overview. Current one is too complex.  
      * Olfaction branch: infotax  
           * [ ] **06-09**: detailed explaination, every parameter needs to be explained. don't jump steps  
           * [ ] **06-09**: Use pesduo code to explain the infotaxis algorithm (how other people explain infotaxis)  
      * Vision branch: semantic grounding  
      * Fusion  
      
## Real world implementation
* [ ] Figure out how to integrate chemical sensor with the Turtlebot4  
    * [ ] Find examples where people use Turtlebot4 with other sensors (such as examples of people use Turtlebot4 usb ports. perhaps the USB port is the solution. Perhaps the usb port and Power and Read sensor data simultaneously)

            * ... ...  
      
## Sample run
* [ ] Live demonstration in June 4th 10:00 AM  
      * Prepare some demos with Turtlebot 3 or 4.  

## Source declaration  
* [x] Develop a source declaration method based on olfactory entropy threshold
