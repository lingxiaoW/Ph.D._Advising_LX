## 1. Paper Writing
* [ ] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**
      * wait on my comments. 

## Real world implementation
* [ ] Figure out how to integrate chemical sensor with the Turtlebot4  
      * [ ] Find examples where people use Turtlebot4 with other sensors (such as examples of people use Turtlebot4 usb ports. perhaps the USB port is the solution. Perhaps the usb port and Power and Read sensor data simultaneously)

            * Link 2:  
            * ... ...  
      
## Sample run
* [ ] Live demonstration in June 4th 10:00 AM  
      * Prepare some demos with Turtlebot 3 or 4.  

## Source declaration
* [x] Develop a source declaration method based on olfactory entropy threshold
