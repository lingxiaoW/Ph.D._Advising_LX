## 1. Paper Writing
* [ ] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**
  * Search for "LX: " in overleaf. Address my questions and comments.
  Subtitles:
  * An overview: (flow diagram: in-output of infotax and vision branch > fusion) parameters of input-output.
    * [ ] **06-09**: Simple flow chart in the overview. Current one is too complex. **06-11**: Edit the flow chart, follow the vilt paper.
    * **Olfaction branch: source likelihood map**
      * [x] **06-09**: detailed explaination, every parameter needs to be explained. don't jump steps. **06-11** You miss the key equation explanation: convert the concentration to likelihood map eqn 9.
      * [x] **06-19**: Source term estimation seems to fit the equation. understand the thoery and check if we can use this thoery for our paper.
      * [x] **06-25**: Adpat source term estimation to fit our concentration equation.
         * Write equations in full details.   
         * **Our goal**: we need a source probability estimation algorithm without wind information.
         * **06-30**: your code should follow your literature.
         * **07-03**: source term estimation. Find a toy example on source term estimation. Figure out the thoery and then do the step-by-step analysis on OSL.
         * **07-07**: olfaction branch is OK now. In the experiment, start with illustration of olfaction map (at start, at t 10, 20, etc.).
     * **Vision branch: semantic grounding**
        * [x] **07-07**: start vision branch - the main question to answer is how to get the vision probability map. Step 1 details, step 2 details, etc. Use pictures to illustrate each step.
        * [ ] **07-10**: draw the flowchart **following the existing code**. Don't make the flowchart too complex. Summarise key steps.
          * [ ] **07-23** 3D object position equation explanation
            * [x] **07-28**: all angles use rad no degrees 
          * [ ] **07-23** diagrams to explain 3D object position equation explanation
          * [ ] **07-28**: for semantic similarity, add a flow diagram & cosine similiarity equation. Explain what's Od, Ob in the text. Add diagonal. Add the equation in writeup, not in diagram. Express the vectors with shape in the diagram. Just keep a symbol for score.
    * **Fusion & Navigation**
      * [ ] **07-28**: add a psudo code.
        * [ ] **07-31**: remove if else t<4 for initialization - just mention it.
        * [ ] **07-31**: change code to np.log2. Check normalization in code and paper - paper will follow code.
        * [ ] **07-31**: check all equations against code - every equation should be the same in the code. Search TODO in the code.
      
## Real world implementation
* [ ] Figure out how to integrate chemical sensor with the Turtlebot4  
  * [ ] Find examples where people use Turtlebot4 with other sensors (such as examples of people use Turtlebot4 usb ports. perhaps the USB port is the solution. Perhaps the usb port and Power and Read sensor data simultaneously)  
  * Link 1:  
  * Link 2:  
  * ... ...  
      
## Sample run
* [ ] Live demonstration in June 4th 10:00 AM
  * Prepare some demos with Turtlebot 3 or 4.  

## Source declaration  
* [x] Develop a source declaration method based on olfactory entropy threshold
