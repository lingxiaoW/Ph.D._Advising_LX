## 1. Paper Writing
* [x] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**
* [ ] Methodology
  * [ ] Check vision localization function first.
  * [ ] 1. Check the plot - print object names next to the points.
  * [ ] 2. Get a ground truth object position map.
  * [ ] 3. New navigation: one step at a time instead of going to the midpoint.
  * [ ] Multiply the olfaction map with the vision map (after vision map apply Gaussian) to get the goal map (no Gaussian on the goal map).
  
* [x] Experiments
  * [ ] Clean the code
    * [ ] Upload on Github code page.
    * [ ] Add explanation of percentile.
    * [ ] Save the 4 initial frames.
    * [ ] Correct the z axis in heatmaps.

 * [ ] Start writing the Experiment Section on the paper draft
   * [ ] Start talking about the simulation environment. Create a map of the reachable points - two top down view maps for room 1 and 2, show objects snaps in the top down map (oven, table, toilet, etc.).
   * [ ] Sample run of 3 algorithms.
   * [ ] Repeated test, combined trajectories and table
     * [ ] Table: show travelled distance, success rate, number of steps


## 3. Teaching the Lab
* You need to go through the lab manual before students do the lab.
* Your first class will be at next week.
