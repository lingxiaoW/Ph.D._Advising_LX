## 1. Paper Writing
* [ ] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**
    * **Fusion & Navigation**
        * [ ] Repeated tests: 2 rooms * 3 algorithms (F, O, R) * 16 starting positions per scenario.
          * [ ] Room 1
            * [ ] Fusion
            * [ ] Olfaction
            * [ ] Random walk
          * [ ] Room 2
            * [ ] Fusion
            * [ ] Olfaction
            * [ ] Random walk
    * [ ] Start writing the Experiment Section on the paper draft
      * [ ] Start talking about the simulation environment. Create a map of the reachable points - two top down view maps for room 1 and 2, show objects snaps in the top down map (oven, table, toilet, etc.).
      * [ ] Sample run of 3 algorithms.
      * [ ] Repeated test, combined trajectories and table
        * [ ] Table: show travelled distance, success rate, number of steps


## 3. Teaching the Lab
* You need to go through the lab manual before students do the lab.
* Your first class will be at next week.
