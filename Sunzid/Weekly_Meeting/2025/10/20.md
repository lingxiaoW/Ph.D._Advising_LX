## 1. Paper Writing
* [x] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**
* [x] Experiments
  * [ ] Clean the code
    * [ ] Create 3 folders - fusion, olfaction-only, random walk. Each folder contains two subfolders - sample run and repeated tests. Inside each folder is a project including main.py, function.py, etc.
    * [ ] Each function add docstring that explains all the parameters.
    * [ ] Upload on Github code page.
    * [ ] Use seed to fix random number (exploration steps) so that other people get the same result.

 * [ ] Start writing the Experiment Section on the paper draft
   * [ ] Start talking about the simulation environment. Create a map of the reachable points - two top down view maps for room 1 and 2, show objects snaps in the top down map (oven, table, toilet, etc.).
   * [ ] Sample run of 3 algorithms.
   * [ ] Repeated test, combined trajectories and table
     * [ ] Table: show travelled distance, success rate, number of steps


## 3. Teaching the Lab
* You need to go through the lab manual before students do the lab.
* Your first class will be at next week.
