## 1. Paper Writing
* [ ] Methodology
  
* [x] Experiments
  * [ ] Clean the code
    * [ ] Upload on Github code page.
    
 * [ ] Start writing the Experiment Section on the paper draft.
  * [ ] Describe that the fusion method can detect object while the olfactory method can't point out which object is the odor source.
  * [ ] Figure 6: Only show the source object and its location in the map like the previous paper.
  * [ ] In repeated test, show a figure of all initial starting positions.
  * [ ] Figure 7: 
   * [ ] Show trajectory in a seperate figure first, and then show the steps. Keep the aspect ratio square.
   * [ ] Show 1 concentration ruler next to the multimodal distribution.
  * [ ] Repeated test, combined trajectories and table
    * [ ] Trajectories: show all 32 trajectories for 1 parameter value for each environment 32 runs - 8 figures in a row * 4 rows.
