## 1. Paper Writing
* [x] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**
* [ ] Methodology
  * [x] Use the oneStep control algorithms.
  * [x] Check the difference between min-max and divide by sum. Then change all normalization to min-max [0-1] range.
  * [x] Add explanation of percentile.
  
* [x] Experiments
  * [ ] Clean the code
    * [ ] Upload on Github code page.
    
 * [ ] Start writing the Experiment Section on the paper draft.
   * [ ] Finish substantial progress on the paper.
   * [ ] Figure 6: make text large enough to see the content.
   * [ ] Figure 7: remove the concentration ruler. Make the trajectory subfigure smaller and the entropy maps larger.
   * [ ] Cite the infotax paper for the gaussian model equation, and the other paper for parameter values.
   * [x] Start talking about the simulation environment. Create a map of the reachable points - two top down view maps for room 1 and 2, show objects snaps in the top down map (oven, table, toilet, etc.).
   * [ ] Repeated test, combined trajectories and table
     * [ ] Trajectories: for all 32 runs - 8 figures in a row * 4 rows.
     * [ ] Table: show all 16 trajectory values of the two environments - travelled distance and show travelled distance, success rate
