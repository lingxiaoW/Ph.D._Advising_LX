## 1. Paper Writing
* [ ] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**
    * **Fusion & Navigation**
        * [ ] Complete the simulation tests. Then it can be a paper.
        * [ ] Repeated tests: 2 rooms * 3 algorithms (F, O, R) * 16 starting positions per scenario.
          * [ ] Olfaction-only: same initial locations, use olfaction map only, go to the middle point of the nearest highest cell.
          * [ ] Random-walk: same initial locations, randomly choose among 4 actions (front, left, right, back), higher step limit (50).
          * [ ] In the paper present trajectory of all initial locations for the proposed method. Put all trajectories in one map. Don't add the middle points and arrows - just the starting and ending point. Keep the middle points in the sample run trajectory.
## Real world implementation
* [ ] Figure out how to integrate chemical sensor with the Turtlebot4  
  * [ ] Find examples where people use Turtlebot4 with other sensors (such as examples of people use Turtlebot4 usb ports. perhaps the USB port is the solution. Perhaps the usb port and Power and Read sensor data simultaneously)


## 3. Teaching the Lab
* You need to go through the lab manual before students do the lab.
* Your first class will be at next week.
