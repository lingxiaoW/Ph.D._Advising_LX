## 1. Paper Writing
* [ ] **Prepare a draft methodology of paper to illustrate methodology**
    * **Fusion & Navigation**
        * [ ] Complete the simulation tests. Then it can be a paper.
        * [ ] Sample run
            * [x] At starting location, record the 4 angles.
            * [x] Fix the position vs frame saved error.
            * [x] In the trajectory log, record the target names for all steps.
            * [x] At every step, save the detected objects and their coordinate values.
            * [x] The robot heading is wrong in the final frame - fix it.
        * [ ] Repeated tests: 2 rooms * 3 algorithms (F, O, R) * 16 starting positions per scenario.
## Real world implementation
* [ ] Figure out how to integrate chemical sensor with the Turtlebot4  
  * [ ] Find examples where people use Turtlebot4 with other sensors (such as examples of people use Turtlebot4 usb ports. perhaps the USB port is the solution. Perhaps the usb port and Power and Read sensor data simultaneously)


## 3. Teaching the Lab
* You need to go through the lab manual before students do the lab.
* Your first class will be at next week.
