### Polymer Paper
* My biggest concern is these numbers
    * Double check each number in the table. 
    * Every number should be supported by the code
    * Take the snapshot to support each number. 
* Once you complete this, submit it to the journal.


### Facial Expression Recognition

* Many papers are using DL models to detect facial expressions. 
* Start with a training dataset. 
* You can use a pre-trained model (CNN from stratch).
* We need a demo (input is an image, the output includes bounding boxes and text of facial expression).
