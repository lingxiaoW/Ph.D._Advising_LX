### Polymer Paper
* Send a email to the editor, asking about how to upload latex file. 

### Facial Expression Recognition

* Many papers are using DL models to detect facial expressions. 
* Start with a training dataset. 
    * FER2013 (attach a link here)
* You can use a pre-trained model (CNN from stratch).
    * RESNet 50 as the backbone
* We need a demo (input is an image, the output includes bounding boxes and text of facial expression). 
    * **Improve the performance**. (> 0.7)
    * Show the testing image in a row. (you can use the image from the testing dataset).
