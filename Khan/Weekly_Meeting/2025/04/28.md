### Facial Expression Recognition

* Many papers are using DL models to detect facial expressions. 
* Start with a training dataset. 
    * FER2013 (attach a link here)
* You can use a pre-trained model (CNN from stratch).
    * RESNet 50 as the backbone
* We need a demo (input is an image, the output includes bounding boxes and text of facial expression). 
    * **Improve the performance**. (> 0.7)
    * Show the testing image in a row. (you can use the image from the testing dataset).

* **GPT-based Method**
    * We are more interested in providing an image of classroom to the GPT and ask it to tell which students are engaged, which students are not engaged. 
    * Provide hints to GPT to tell how to determine student engagement. 
        * Facial Expression: Engage (happy, neutral); Not engaged (sad, board, angry)
        * Gesture: provide some examples here. 
    * The output image should be bounding boxes of students with labels like engaged/not engaged.
