* LLM-based Autonomous Driving Project
    * Similar to DiLu: We want to use LLM to control a vehicle in autonomous driving. 
    * Dilu uses highwayEnv. 
    * In our case, we provide images to LLM (images captured from the front view camera)

* The final product is similar to Table 1 in DriveGPT4 (driveLME).
    * **Check "Reference-Autonomous Driving-Research Plan.pdf" for the guidence.**
    * We provide front view camera images and LLM gives the action
    * These images are opensource image dataset
    * Our final goal is to implement this on a robotic vehicle in a simulated traffic environment. 
    * Find a few open source projects to get familiar with this concept and then think about to how modify it. 

* [ ] Literature review: Find articles of LLM-based autonomous driving applications. 


* I need a demo:
    * Find and install an autonomous driving simulator (CARLA, or others). Ask Sunzid (he knows how to get dual system PC). Maybe you can try virtual machine.
    * Step 1: You use keyboard to control the vehicle (you can control the vehicle) 
    * Step 2: You can use a Python code to control the vehicle. 
        * For instance, in the Python code, you provide the way points, the vehicle can follow them. 
    * CARLA dataset is also OK for getting the initial demo of using LLM to analyze the vehicle action. 
    * Check the proposal that I uploaded.
