* The final product is similar to Table 1 in DriveGPT4 (driveLME).
    * We provide front view camera images and LLM gives the action
    * Our final goal is to implement this on a robotic vehicle in a simulated traffic environment. 
    * Find a few open source projects to get familiar with this concept and then think about to how modify it. 

* [ ] Literature review: Find articles of LLM-based autonomous driving applications. 


* Try these:
    * [ ] how to control the vehicle using the code (like provide GO, can the vehicle follow? Provide SLOW, can the vehicle follow?)
    * [ ] check the LLM reasoning result. Just use some sample images (steering wheel front image or the original image) to test the reasoning result. 
    * [ ] if the reasoning result is correct, figure out why the vehicle does not follow.
