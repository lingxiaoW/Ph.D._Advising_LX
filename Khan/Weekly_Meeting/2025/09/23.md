* The final product is similar to Table 1 in DriveGPT4 (driveLME).
    * We provide front view camera images and LLM gives the action
    * Our final goal is to implement this on a robotic vehicle in a simulated traffic environment. 
    * Find a few open source projects to get familiar with this concept and then think about to how modify it. 

* [ ] Literature review: Find articles of LLM-based autonomous driving applications. 


* Try these:
    * [ ] how to control the vehicle using the code
        * Explain here using pesduo code
        * waypoints, road_option = route_planner(start, destination)
        * ...
        * **output** = LLM(input)
            * Is the **output** executed or not?
        * If the LLM gives "FOLLOW", how Carla intreprate this command to control the vehicle?
    * [ ] check the LLM reasoning result. 
        * Use the debug function to see the LLM input and output at each time step. 
        * I need to see inputs and outputs to the LLM and check whether the vehcile is following the LLM commands. 
        * It is not showing me a video becuase you don't know what is right what is wrong in the video.
