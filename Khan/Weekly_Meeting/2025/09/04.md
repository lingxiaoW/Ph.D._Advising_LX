* LLM-based Autonomous Driving Project
    * Similar to DiLu: We want to use LLM to control a vehicle in autonomous driving. 
    * Dilu uses highwayEnv. 
    * In our case, we provide images to LLM (images captured from the front view camera)

* The final product is similar to Table 1 in DriveGPT4 (driveLME).
    * We provide front view camera images and LLM gives the action
    * These images are opensource image dataset
    * Our final goal is to implement this on a robotic vehicle in a simulated traffic environment. 
    * Find a few open source projects to get familiar with this concept and then think about to how modify it. 

* [ ] Literature review: Find articles of LLM-based autonomous driving applications. 
* [x] Clean up the code for the first paper
* [x] Add ReadMe for other projects.ReadMe should be specific: what steps to do to achieve what functionality.
