* Pesduo-code:
```
time = 0
while:
    vehicle_status = get_vehicle_status(time)
    environment_status = get_env_status(time)
    behavior = LLM(vehicle_status, environment_status)
    if behavior == "GO":
        GO()
    If behavior == "Follow":
        Follow()
    ...
    time = time + 1
```

* [ ] **Task 1:** LLM-based Traffic Light Detection
    * Tune the system prompt and user prompt.
    * Provide examples of correct red/green/yellow images and sample reasons
    * Test the LLM with the red/green/yellow images from another junction

* [ ] **Task 2:** YOLO-based Traffic Light Detection
    * Problem 1: 
        * Focus on v4 with R1 (when the vehicle enters the Bottom junction, YOLO did not detect the traffic light)
        * Check YOLO result on the single image (the image of the bottom junction)
    * Problem 2:
        * The current logic is wrong: when you enter traffic light, you stop. This is wrong. 
        * The correct logis ic you check traffic light all the time, if it is green, you should go; if it is red, you should stop. 
        * Right now, you use CARLA function to determine whether the vehicle is in the junction. 
        * Try this: You run the YOLO all the time. When YOLO detects traffic light, if it is green -> you go; if it is red -> you stop 5 meters before the stop line.
