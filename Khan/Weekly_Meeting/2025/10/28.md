* Pesduo-code:
```
time = 0
while:
    vehicle_status = get_vehicle_status(time)
    environment_status = get_env_status(time)
    behavior = LLM(vehicle_status, environment_status)
    if behavior == "GO":
        GO()
    If behavior == "Follow":
        Follow()
    ...
    time = time + 1
```
* [x] Summarize GO() & STOP() code. 
* [x] Do these steps:
    * Use a LLM to generate actions (only two actions: Go or Stop)
    * Inputs to LLM: Just front-view image of the vehicle

* [ ] Task 1: Provide individual traffic light image (cropped) to LLM to check its effectiveness.
* [ ] Task 2: Let LLM make a single decision.
    * Step 1: Let the vehicle stops at the junction. 
    * Step 2: Let LLM decide go or stop (provide a cropped image of traffic light)
        * If the decision is go, then go (until the next junction, use LLM)
        * If the decision is stop, ask again after 1 min

* [ ] Use YOLO to detect traffic light, convert traffic light image into text, then ask LLM. 
    * We can also use YOLO to detect signs. (Stop sign) -> convert the detection into text.
