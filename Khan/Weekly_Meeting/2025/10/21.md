* Pesduo-code:
```
time = 0
while:
    vehicle_status = get_vehicle_status(time)
    environment_status = get_env_status(time)
    behavior = LLM(vehicle_status, environment_status)
    if behavior == "GO":
        GO()
    If behavior == "Follow":
        Follow()
    ...
    time = time + 1
```
* Summarize GO() & STOP() code. 
* Do these steps:
    * Use a LLM to generate actions (only two actions: Go or Stop)
    * Inputs to LLM: Just front-view image of the vehicle



* How the global route plan is generated? 
    * If I want the vehicle to loop on the outside loop, how to achieve this?
    * If I want the vehicle to loop inside the loop, how to achieve this?
* How to define the vehicle initial position? 
* A global map with coordination
    * Attach your picture here.
* Check API. check other people's work (find examples. Reinforcement learning using carla)
