* LLM-based Autonomous Driving Project
    * Similar to DiLu: We want to use LLM to control a vehicle in autonomous driving. 
    * Dilu uses highwayEnv. 
    * In our case, we provide images to LLM (images captured from the front view camera)

* [ ] Literature review: Find articles of LLM-based autonomous driving applications. 
* [ ] Clean up the code for the first paper
* [ ] Add ReadMe for other projects.ReadMe should be specific: what steps to do to achieve what functionality.
